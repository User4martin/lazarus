The gtk2 interface for lazarus
==============================

The gtk2 interface for lazarus is a descendant of the gtk interface. It is not
yet complete. For those who want to help us here are some hints:

With fpc 1.9.7 the gtk2 bindings are included, so forget the packages.

To compile the gtk2 interface just set
Tools -> Configure Build Lazarus -> LCL interface to 'gtk2'

Creating a test project:

Create a new lazarus application. This project will be used to test the gtk2
interface and to store all configuration steps.
Then open the compiler options and set as widget type 'gtk2'.
