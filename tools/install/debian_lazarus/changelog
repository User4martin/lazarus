lazarus (0.9.24)

The Lazarus IDE is started with "startlazarus" or directly with "lazarus-ide".
Formerly "lazarus-ide" was "lazarus", but due to a conflict with the tct package
it has been renamed. That's why it is now "lazarus-ide".
Please check your desktop icons.


lazarus (0.9.22)

The Lazarus IDE is started with "startlazarus" or directly with "lazarus".
Some other lazarus packages out there uses "lazarus-ide" to start.

icons.
