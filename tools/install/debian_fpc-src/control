Description: Free Pascal Sources
 The Free Pascal Compiler is a Turbo Pascal 7.0 and Delphi compatible 
 32/64bit Object Pascal Compiler. It comes with fully TP 7.0
 compatible run-time library.
 Some extensions are added to the language, like function overloading. Shared
 libraries can be linked and created. Basic Delphi support is already
 implemented (classes,exceptions,ansistrings). This package contains the
 sources for the compiler, the rtl, fcl and packages.
