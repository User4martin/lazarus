Description: IDE for Free Pascal to create (graphical and console) applications
 Lazarus is an IDE to create (graphical and console) applications with Free
 Pascal. Free Pascal is a (L)GPL'ed Pascal and Object Pascal compiler that runs
 on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and more.
 .
 Lazarus is the missing part of the puzzle that will allow you to develop
 programs for all of the above platforms in a Delphi like environment.
 The IDE is a RAD tool that includes a form designer.
 .
 Unlike Java's "write once, run anywhere" motto, Lazarus and Free Pascal
 strive for "write once, compile anywhere". Since the exact same compiler
 is available on all of the above platforms you don't need to do any recoding
 to produce identical products for different platforms.
 .
 In short, Lazarus is a free RAD tool for Free Pascal using its Lazarus 
 Component Library (LCL).
 .
 This is a metapackage depending on all packages need to have a typical
 Lazarus installation.

 be viewed separately with any HTML browser or used by the IDE to as an
 integrated help (pressing <F1> on any LCL identifier will browse the help of
 that identifier).
