_Description: Rename "/etc/lazarus" to "/etc/lazarus.bak"?
 The Lazarus suite now supports keeping multiple versions installed
 at the same time and using the alternatives system to set proper
 defaults. Normally, the latest version of any component is used.
 .
 To use the alternatives system on the system-wide configuration
 of the Lazarus suite, /etc/lazarus needs to be under control of the
 alternatives system. Currently there is a real directory at
 /etc/lazarus, probably from a previous installation. In order to
 start using the alternatives system on the configuration you must
 accept renaming "/etc/lazarus". If you don't, you will need to
 review the configuration on every version update of Lazarus as,
 unfortunately, the configuration files are not always
 backward-compatible. Also switching between different versions
 might need more intervention.
 .
 If you have made changes to your configuration files, you will
 probably need to review them and apply them to all versioned
 configurations, as they will not automatically propagate.
