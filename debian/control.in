Description: IDE for Free Pascal - Meta Package
 Lazarus is an IDE to create (graphical and console) applications with Free
 Pascal. Free Pascal is a (L)GPL'ed Pascal and Object Pascal compiler that runs
 on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and more.
 .
 Lazarus is the missing part of the puzzle that will allow you to develop
 programs for all of the above platforms in a Delphi like environment.
 The IDE is a RAD tool that includes a form designer.
 .
 Unlike Java's "write once, run anywhere" motto, Lazarus and Free Pascal
 strive for "write once, compile anywhere". Since the exact same compiler
 is available on all of the above platforms you don't need to do any recoding
 to produce identical products for different platforms.
 .
 In short, Lazarus is a free RAD tool for Free Pascal using its Lazarus
 Component Library (LCL).
 .
 This is a metapackage depending on all packages need to have a typical
 Lazarus installation.

 Unlike Java's "write once, run anywhere" motto, Lazarus and Free Pascal
 strive for "write once, compile anywhere". Since the exact same compiler
 is available on all of the above platforms you don't need to do any recoding
 to produce identical products for different platforms.

 In short, Lazarus is a free RAD tool for Free Pascal using its Lazarus
 Component Library (LCL).
 .
 This package contains the LCL and components Qt based backend. Actually this is
 an empty package but will not be in the future.

Description: IDE for Free Pascal - Documentation metapackage
 Lazarus is an IDE to create (graphical and console) applications with Free
 Pascal. Free Pascal is a (L)GPL'ed Pascal and Object Pascal compiler that runs
 on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and more.
 .
 Lazarus is the missing part of the puzzle that will allow you to develop
 programs for all of the above platforms in a Delphi like environment.
 The IDE is a RAD tool that includes a form designer.

 This package contains documentation of the lazarus IDE and components. It can
 be viewed separately with any HTML browser or used by the IDE to as an
 integrated help (pressing <F1> on any LCL identifier will browse the help of
 that identifier).
