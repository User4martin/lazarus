lazarus (1.0.8+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Abou Al Montacir ]
  * New upstream major release and multiple maintenace release offering many
    fixes and new features marking a new milestone for the Lazarus development
    and its stability level.
    - The detailed list of changes can be found here:
      http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_1.0_release_notes
      http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_1.0_fixes_branch
  * LCL changes:
    - LCL is now a normal package.
        + Platform independent parts of the LCL are now in the package LCLBase
        + LCL is automatically recompiled when switching the target platform,
          unless pre-compiled binaries for this target are already installed.
        + No impact on existing projects.
        + Linker options needed by LCL are no more added to projects that do
          not use the LCL package.
    - Minor changes in LCL basic classes behaviour
        + TCustomForm.Create raises an exception if a form resource is not
          found.
        + TNotebook and TPage: a new implementation of these classes was added.
        + TDBNavigator: It is now possible to have focusable buttons by setting
          Options = [navFocusableButtons] and TabStop = True, useful for
          accessibility and for devices with neither mouse nor touch screen.
        + Names of TControlBorderSpacing.GetSideSpace and GetSpace were swapped
          and are now consistent. GetSideSpace = Around + GetSpace.
        + TForm.WindowState=wsFullscreen was added
        + TCanvas.TextFitInfo was added to calculate how many characters will
          fit into a specified Width. Useful for word-wrapping calculations.
        + TControl.GetColorResolvingParent and
          TControl.GetRGBColorResolvingParent were added, simplifying the work
          to obtain the final color of the control while resolving clDefault
          and the ParentColor.
        + LCLIntf.GetTextExtentExPoint now has a good default implementation
          which works in any platform not providing a specific implementation.
          However, Widgetset specific implementation is better, when available.
        + TTabControl was reorganized. Now it has the correct class hierarchy
          and inherits from TCustomTabControl as it should.
    - New unit in the LCL:
        + lazdialogs.pas: adds non-native versions of various native dialogs,
          for example TLazOpenDialog, TLazSaveDialog, TLazSelectDirectoryDialog.
          It is used by widgetsets which either do not have a native dialog, or
          do not wish to use it because it is limited. These dialogs can also be
          used by user applications directly.
        + lazdeviceapis.pas: offers an interface to more hardware devices such
          as the accelerometer, GPS, etc. See LazDeviceAPIs
        + lazcanvas.pas: provides a TFPImageCanvas descendent implementing
          drawing in a LCL-compatible way, but 100% in Pascal.
        + lazregions.pas. LazRegions is a wholly Pascal implementation of
          regions for canvas clipping, event clipping, finding in which control
          of a region tree one an event should reach, for drawing polygons, etc.
        + customdrawncontrols.pas, customdrawndrawers.pas,
          customdrawn_common.pas, customdrawn_android.pas and
          customdrawn_winxp.pas: are the Lazarus Custom Drawn Controls -controls
          which imitate the standard LCL ones, but with the difference that they
          are non-native and support skinning.
    - New APIs added to the LCL to improve support of accessibility software
      such as screen readers.
  * IDE changes:
    - Many improvments.
    - The detailed list of changes can be found here:
      http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/New_IDE_features_since#v1.0_.282012-08-29.29
      http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_1.0_release_notes#IDE_Changes
  * Debugger / Editor changes:
    - Added pascal sources and breakpoints to the disassembler
    - Added threads dialog.
  * Components changes:
    - TAChart: many fixes and new features
    - CodeTool: support Delphi style generics and new syntax extensions.
    - AggPas: removed to honor free licencing. (Closes: Bug#708695)
  [Bart Martens]
  * New debian/watch file fixing issues with upstream RC release.
  [Abou Al Montacir]

  [Paul Gevers]
  * Updated get-orig-source target and it compinion script orig-tar.sh so that
    they repack the source file, allowing bug 708695 to be fixed.

      into another, using a separate intfimage as the alpha channel.
    - Unit chart and its component TBarChar are deprecated in favor of new

      ending of the first line, it does not preserve mixed line endings).
    - You can now quickly switch between several versions / branches of packages

      a new package EducationLaz adding options to hide complex parts of the IDE
