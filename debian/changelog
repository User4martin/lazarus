lazarus (0.9.30-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release many fixes and new features.
    - The detailed list of changes can be found here:
      http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_0.9.30_release_notes
  * LCL changes:
    - Windows CE: support for clipboard and keypad devices
    - GTK2 and GTK1 interfaces are now separated.
    - GTK1 is no longer maintained by Lazarus team, but patches are accepted.
    - fpGUI: LCL interface now supports all components on the standard page.
    - QT support for Haiku
    - Layout and autosizing is now more consistent across widgetsets,
      overhead was reduced, improved cross platform layouts and complex forms.
    - Added gif reader
    - TLazIntfImage: New function AlphaBlend, which can alpha blend an intfimage
      into another, using a separate intfimage as the alpha channel.
    - Unit chart and its component TBarChar are deprecated in favor of new
      package TAChartLazarusPkg.
  * IDE:
    - Support of FPC resources: {$R *.lfm} instead of {$i unit1.lrs}.
    - The Delphi converter has improved a lot.
    - Build modes, build macros and conditionals now allows different sets of
      compiler options for projects and packages.
    - Editor improvements:
      + Hiding (Folding) of comments in Pascal source.
      + Allow Multiple Source-Editor Windows
      + Allow several Views of the same Source
      + User-defined color-schemes.
      + Identifier-completion pop-up is now resizable
    - Project compiler options can now be saved as default for new projects.
    - When opening a project only those forms are opened that were open when
      project was closed.
    - Various designer usability improvements:
      + arrow and tab keys switching between components
      + resize/move cancellation using ESC key
      + save/restore of the form window state in the project session
      + skip snapping when Alt key is pressed
    - When creating a new project the default unit output directory is now
      lib/$(TargetCPU)-$(TargetOS). Target file name is project1. This has no
      impact on old projects.
    - IDE now preserves the line endings of source files (it uses the line
      ending of the first line, it does not preserve mixed line endings).
    - You can now quickly switch between several versions / branches of packages
      by defining the preferred package file name for each dependency.
    - You can now use the IDE directive %H- to hide individual hints, notes and
      warnings.
    - The IDE can be made dockable. Install either the package AnchorDockingDsgn
      or EasyDockMgrDsgn.
    - The ToDo list was moved to a separate package: todolistlaz.lpk.
    - Czech translation added
  * Debugger / Editor:
    - Inserted/Deleted lines during a debug session are now tracked. Breakpoints
      and Execution-line are adjusted.
    - Step out command implementation (by Flavio)
    - Show execution point command
    - Single Instruction step (over/into)
    - UI Improvements: Toolbars for Watches, Breakpoints, Disassembler
    - Watches: Enabled display formats (mem-dump, Hex, Default, ..)
    - Disassembler added navigation: jump to address / return to execution point
    - Improved reaction speed: It is possible to continue stepping without
      having to wait for all watches, locals, ... to be evaluated
  * Components:
    - IDE got some options to become easier for students and pupils and there is
      a new package EducationLaz adding options to hide complex parts of the IDE
    - New AggPas (Anti Grain Geometry for Object Pascal) package, now supporting
      FPImage and LCL. AggPas highlights: Subpixel rendering, 8-bit alpha
      channel, paths, platform independent rendering using pure pascal
    - TAChart update, including: stacked and rotated series, 3 new types of
      series, axis transformations, interactive tools, 6 new demos and other
      improvements
  * Added metapackges in order to ease upgrading and fixed dependcy rules.
    (Closes: Bug#620108)
  * Test for dh_input exit status 30 as this is a normal exit status which just
    informs that the question was not displayed because of its priority.
