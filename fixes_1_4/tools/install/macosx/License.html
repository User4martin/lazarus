In general it is allowed to use Lazarus to write commercial, closed source applications. Here are some hints about the few exceptions and some more details:<br>
<p><br></p>
Lazarus consists of several parts and each has its own license. Three licenses are in use. The GPL 2, a modified LGPL and the MPL. In general, each file contains a header, describing the license of the file.<br>

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<p><br></p>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, US<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<p><br></p>
                           Preamble<br>
<p><br></p>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<p><br></p>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<p><br></p>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<p><br></p>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<p><br></p>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<p><br></p>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<p><br></p>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<p><br></p>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<p><br></p>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<p><br></p>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<p><br></p>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<p><br></p>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<p><br></p>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<p><br></p>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<p><br></p>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
License.(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<p><br></p>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<p><br></p>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<p><br></p>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<p><br></p>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<p><br></p>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
to distribute corresponding source code.(This alternative is<br>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<p><br></p>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<p><br></p>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<p><br></p>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<p><br></p>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<p><br></p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<p><br></p>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<p><br></p>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<p><br></p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<p><br></p>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<p><br></p>
                           NO WARRANT<br>
<p><br></p>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<p><br></p>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<p><br></p>
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITION<br>
<br>
       Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Program<br>
<p><br></p>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<p><br></p>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<p><br></p>
&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
Copyright (C) 20yy&lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<p><br></p>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
(at your option) any later version.<br>
<p><br></p>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<p><br></p>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.<br>
<p><br></p>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<p><br></p>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<p><br></p>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 20yy name of author<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<p><br></p>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<p><br></p>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<p><br></p>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<p><br></p>
&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<p><br></p>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>

<hr>

<p><br></p>
modified LGPL:<br>
<p><br></p>
As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you<br>
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an<br>
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,<br>
and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,<br>
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms<br>
and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a<br>
module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this<br>
library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but<br>
you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this<br>
exception statement from your version.<br>
<p><br></p>
GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<p><br></p>
Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA02111-1307US<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<p><br></p>
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.It is<br>
numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br>
<p><br></p>
Preamble<br>
<p><br></p>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<p><br></p>
This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.You can use it for<br>
your libraries, too.<br>
<p><br></p>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<p><br></p>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br>
<p><br></p>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<p><br></p>
Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<p><br></p>
Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
library.If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br>
the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br>
transforming the program into proprietary software.To prevent this,<br>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<p><br></p>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.This<br>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br>
designated libraries.This license is quite different from the ordinary<br>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br>
the same as in the ordinary license.<br>
<p><br></p>
The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br>
program and simply using it.Linking a program with a library, without<br>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.However, in<br>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br>
treats it as such.<br>
<p><br></p>
Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.We<br>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br>
<p><br></p>
However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br>
libraries themselves.This Library General Public License is intended to<br>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br>
libraries that are incorporated in them.(We have not seen how to achieve<br>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)The hope is that this<br>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br>
<p><br></p>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br>
works together with the library.<br>
<p><br></p>
Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<br>
<br>
GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<p><br></p>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br>
General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<p><br></p>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<p><br></p>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.(Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<p><br></p>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<p><br></p>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<p class="p2">  <br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<p><br></p>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<p><br></p>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<p><br></p>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<p><br></p>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<p><br></p>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
application.Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<p><br></p>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<p><br></p>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<p><br></p>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.(If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<p><br></p>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<p><br></p>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<p><br></p>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<p><br></p>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<p><br></p>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<p><br></p>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<p><br></p>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<p><br></p>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.You must supply a copy of this License.If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<p><br></p>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
executable containing the modified Library.(It is understood<br>
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<p><br></p>
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<p><br></p>
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
specified materials from the same place.<br>
<p><br></p>
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<p><br></p>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.However, as a special exception,<br>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<p><br></p>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<p><br></p>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
facilities.This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
Sections above.<br>
<p><br></p>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<p><br></p>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<p><br></p>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<p><br></p>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<p><br></p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<p><br></p>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<p><br></p>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<p><br></p>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<p><br></p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<p><br></p>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<p><br></p>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<p><br></p>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<p><br></p>
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Librarie<br>
<p><br></p>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<p><br></p>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<p><br></p>
&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<p><br></p>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br>
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<p><br></p>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the GNU<br>
Library General Public License for more details.<br>
<p><br></p>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br>
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br>
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA02111-1307USA<br>
<p><br></p>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<p><br></p>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<p><br></p>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
