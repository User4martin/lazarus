<h2>Welcome to Lazarus</h2>
Lazarus is a Rapid Application Development Tool for FreePascal.
It comes with the LCL - Lazarus component library, which contains platform independent visual components like buttons, windows, checkbox, treeview and many, many more. The LCL is platform independent, so you can write an application once and then compile for various platforms without changing code.

FreePascal at www.freepascal.org is a fast object pascal compiler (and more), that runs on more than 20 platforms (Mac OS X, Linux, Windows, BSD, OS/2, DOS, PowerPC and many more).

The LCL currently supports Mac OS X (carbon, gtk, gtk2 and qt4), Linux (gtk, gtk2 and qt4), all flavors of Windows, even wince,<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>FreeBSD (gtk, gtk2). There is experimental support for Solaris and the native pascal backend fpgui
which runs on windows, wince and linux.
