Description: Free Pascal Compiler
 Freepascal is a free 32/64bit Pascal Compiler. It comes with a

 function overloading. Shared libraries can be linked. This package
 contains commandline compiler and utils. Provided units are the
 runtime library (RTL), free component library (FCL) and bindings
 for among others gtk1, gtk2, ncurses, zlib, mysql, postgres and
 ibase.
