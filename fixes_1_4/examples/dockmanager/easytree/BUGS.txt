Please check the following list of possible bugs or inconsistencies,
using the widgets at the top of the EasyDocking application main window
- with various widgetsets and
- various settings of the $defines in fMain.

Forms not dockable with some widgetsets?
========================================
With dragForm defined, a form is created on an click on the colored shapes.
This form is not dockable at least with gtk.
[acknowledged by Paul]

With dragForm undefined, a shape control is created and floated manually.
In this case the shape seems to be dockable (also try docking the label).

Edit control not dockable
=========================
The edit control doesn't honor the DragMode and DragKind?
This behaviour may apply to all windowed controls (see Forms above)
A label control seems to be dockable in DragMode=dmAutomatic.

Inconsistent DockRect
=====================
1. The DockRect should be drawn as an outline, as is on Windows.
Using gtk, a filled rectangle is drawn instead.
[fixed]

2. The DockRect should reflect the possible placement of the dragged control on a
dock site, as is on Windows.
On some platforms or widgetsets the rectangle always covers the entire dock site.
This seems to be related to the wrong setting of the drop alignment.
A docking manager, if used, should have full control over the drop alignment.
[fixed, in EasyDockSite]

3. A floating form or dock site in floating state (no DragTarget) should set
the DragRect to the form extent, not to the client extent.
LCL bug: forms use ClientRect for BoundsRect.
[acknowledged by Paul]

Undocking
=========
1. Undocked controls always should be dockable (DragMode=dmAutomatic).

2. A control never should be undocked on a single click on it.
The default mode (DragImediate=True) is inappropriate.
The following bugs are related to this setting.
[partially fixed]

3. When a floating control is only clicked, it never should change
it's size or position on the screen.
[fixed, in EasyDockSite]

4. When a docked control is only clicked, it never should change
it's size or position in the dock site.
[fixed, in Controls.DragManagerDefault]

5. When the header of a docked control is only clicked, the control never should
change it's size or position in the dock site.
[fixed, in EasyDockSite]

6. Docked controls should be undockable by default.

7. Floating controls should be dockable by default.

8. Docked controls should retain their undocked extent.
When a control is undocked into floating state, it retains its size.
When docked and floated again, it has the docked size,
not the original (undocked) size.

Title text
==========
On Windows, the floating forms and dockzones have some text in their title bar.
On gtk no such text is shown.
(Problem with default names for dynamically created controls.
Form title still has to be fixed)
[fixed in Controls]

Resize
======
1. A docksite can be resized by resizing the parent form. The dock manager should
receive an according notification, so that it can resize the docked controls.
[fixed in Controls]

2. Docked controls can be resized with embedded sliders. Some widgetsets seem
not to resize the affected controls, even after an explicit Invalidate.
[fixed in EasyDockSite]

Keyboard
========
1. The DragManager doesn't receive KeyUp and KeyDown notifications.
[fixed]

2. Handle CTRL key, for inhibit dock/drop.

TPageControl
============
Controls can be docked into a notebook (with tabs).

1. A docked TPageControl rejects an initial placement (set BoundsRect).
[fixed]

2. TPageControl does not always allow to undock individual pages.
TControls can be undocked, but not forms.

3. A TPageControl does not resize properly (retains initial place).
(Okay when wrapped into a form, and the form is docked)
[fixed]
