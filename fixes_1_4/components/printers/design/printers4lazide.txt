This package will add a print menu item in the Lazarus main menu (File) and
in the popup menu of the source editor.

There are always some todo's. The ones that came to mind are:

- syntax highlighting
- filename in the header
- pagenumbering
- preferences/settings in the IDE
- print selection
- print range
- line wrapping
- option setting from IDE


Either supply a patch to the lazarus developers or pretty please ask me....
