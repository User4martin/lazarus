"To use the alternatives system on the system-wide configuration of the "
"Lazarus suite, /etc/lazarus needs to be under control of the alternatives "
"system. Currently there is a real directory at /etc/lazarus, probably from a "
"previous installation. In order to start using the alternatives system on "
"the configuration you must accept renaming \"/etc/lazarus\". If you don't, "
"you will need to review the configuration on every version update of Lazarus "
"as, unfortunately, the configuration files are not always backward-"
"compatible. Also switching between different versions might need more "
"intervention."
