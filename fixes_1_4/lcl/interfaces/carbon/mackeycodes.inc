About Mac Key codes:
unfortunately, mac key codes are keyboard specific:
that is, there is no universal VK_A, but every keyboard has its code for VK_A
Key codes depend on physical key position on the keyboard: considering a
QWERTY keyboard and an AZERTY one, keycode(Q) of first one = keycode(A) of
the second one, and so on.
For "printable" keys we can rely on kEventParamKeyMacCharCodes and
kEventParamKeyUnicodes event parameters to obtain an ascii/unicode value
that we can translate to the appropriate VK_ code
For non printable keys (Function, ins, arrow and so on...) we use the raw
keycodes, since it looks like they are constant across all keyboards

So, here are constants for non-printable keys (MK means "Mac Key").
These constants were extracted using KeyCodes program by Peter Maurer
(http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=keycodes)

Some keys were taken from the ancient "Macintosh Toolbox Essentials", page 87
