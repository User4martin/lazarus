fpGUI Toolkit
=============

The official fpGUI website is:

  http://fpgui.sourceforge.net


Getting the source code
-----------------------
The Lazarus svn does not contain the fpGUI sources. You can get the
fpGUI sources via the fpGUI Git repository as follows:

  git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/fpgui/code fpgui-code

...or you can download a zip archive of the latest code, using
the mirror repository on GitHub.

  https://github.com/graemeg/fpGUI/archive/master.zip


Setup to compile LCL-fpGUI
--------------------------

 Option 1)
   Copy the 'src' directory from the fpGUI sources into your Lazarus
   directory as follows:

     <fpgui>/src/ â‡’ <lazarus>/lcl/interfaces/fpgui/src/

 Option 2)
   Use your file systems's symbolic linking function to simply link
   the fpGUI src directory to the correct location in Lazarus.

   For example:
     cd /opt/lazarus/lcl/interfaces/fpgui
     ln -s /path/to/fpgui/src src
