Welcome to Lazarus
==================

Lazarus is a Rapid Application Development Tool for Free Pascal.
It comes with the LCL - Lazarus component library, which contains platform
independent visual components like buttons, windows, checkbox, treeview and
many, many more. The LCL is platform independent, so you can write an
application once and then compile for various platforms without changing code.

Free Pascal at www.freepascal.org is a fast Object Pascal compiler (and more),
that runs on more than 20 platforms (Linux, Windows, BSD, OS/2, DOS, PowerPC,
and many more).

The LCL currently supports Linux (gtk2 and qt4), all flavors of Windows
(even wince), Mac OS X (carbon, gtk2, qt4), FreeBSD (gtk2).
There is experimental support for:
* gtk3
* Solaris 
The LCL still contains code for gtk1 although that is obsolete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation:
You don't need ./configure, just do

  []$ make clean bigide

(BSD users: gmake clean bigide)

This will create the Lazarus executable with a lot of packages.
Start it and enjoy.

If the above gives an error, you can try to build a minimal IDE with
  []$ make clean all

(BSD users: gmake clean all)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation and Requirements:

See the file docs/INSTALL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

Start the IDE with:
  []$ cd your/lazarus/directory
  []$ ./lazarus
