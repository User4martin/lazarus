This directory contains test written with fpcunit. It contains two projects: 
* runtests.lpi for running the tests using the fpcunit console runner.
* runtestsgui.lpi for running the tests using the fpcunit gui runner.


On windows it will run the programs and interact with them using autohotkey.
Currently this is only used with the hello example.
