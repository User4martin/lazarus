This directory contains all images needed by the LCL.
Images are stored in lazarus resource files (.lrs). Each icon is stored
in xpm or png format.

lcl_dbgrid_images.lrs - Icons, included by dbgrids.pas
lcl_dbnav_images.lrs - Icons, included by dbctrls.pas


How to update the image resources:

Creating a lazarus resource can easily be done by the lazres program.
If you have not yet compiled lazres, go to the tools directory and type make.


Under windows use script files: lcl_dbgrid_images.bat, lcl_dbnav_images.bat,
Under other systems use similar script - just replace directory separator.
